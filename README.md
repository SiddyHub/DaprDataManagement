# Dapr Data Management

  Welcome to the Part 2 of the [Dapr Series](https://github.com/SiddyHub/Dapr/tree/eshop_daprized).
  
  The advantage of Microservices is that each Microservice can choose it's own type of Storage. Through this repo, we will check our services use multiple Data Storing technologies.
  Also in the process look at Dapr State Management, Secrets Configuration etc.

  The [main](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprDataManagement) branch, is the code base from [Part 1](https://github.com/SiddyHub/Dapr/tree/eshop_daprized) of the [Dapr Series](https://github.com/SiddyHub/Dapr/tree/eshop_daprized) which covers majority of Dapr Building Blocks,
and [daprDataManagement](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprDataManagement/tree/daprDataManagement) branch is the refactored code base covering Dapr State Management and other concepts.

So please switch to **[daprDataManagement](https://github.com/SiddyHub/DaprDataManagement/tree/daprDataManagement)** branch to follow along.

This version of the code uses **Dapr 1.7**
